# Two Sum Problem

Given a binary array *nums*, return the **maximum length of a contiguous subarray** with an equal number of 0 and 1.

### Example 1:
```
INPUT: nums = [0,1]
OUTPUT: 2
EXPLANATION: [0,1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

### Example 2:
```
INPUT: nums = [0,1,0]
OUTPUT: 2
EXPLANATION: [0,1] (or [1,0]) is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

### Constraints:

- ``` 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5 ```
- ``` nums[i] is either 0 or 1 ```
